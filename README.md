# ffmpeg-compressor
Compress multiple videos with FFmpeg using a Python program.

## How does it work?
Given a directory's path, the program iterates among all the files inside the directory and uses FFmpeg to compress them, saving the output videos in a directory named "compressed". For the correct work of the program, all the files inside the directory should be a video.
